    <h1>What Is Carbon Foot Print</h1>
    <p>A Carbon Footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases that A person emits on a daily basis, things like driving, cooking, and consuming products emit these gases.</p>
    <h1>Why is Reducing Our Carbon Foot Print So Important?</h1>
    <p>Their are many negative consequences that will occur if we do not reduce our Carbon Footprint such as heatwaves. Heatwaves on paper do not sound like something that many would fret over, however the damage dealt to the ecosystems around the world would be detrimental and many crops would die out due to the unfamiliar temperatures. Another example of what could happen if we do not reduce our Carbon Footprint is reduced air quality, which can aggrivate lung conditions and irritate your sinuses as well as affect crops negatively. Finally the most drastic of them all which would be the rising of sea level. This happens due to the melting of the polar ice caps, and this can have horrifying consequences for our planet. An example of this would be Florida, which if we continue to raise our carbon emissions could be submerged in water as early as 2025. Other notable effects would be loss of homes for not just animals but for humans as well and worse hurricanes/storms due to the amount of warm water that could be easily assimilated into the storm due to the raising sea temperatures and level. In conclusion reducing our Carbon Footprint is not only needed to protect ourselves, but to proctect our entire planet and way of life and so many things could be inconvienced or destroyed because of it in the early future.</p>

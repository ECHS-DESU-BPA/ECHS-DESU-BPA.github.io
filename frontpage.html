    <p> Welcome to the "front page"</p>
    <br>
    <p> this is where we will be designing it just so that we can keep the plan and the other stuff on the index page</p>
    <br>
    <p> I want it to be this green but have this cream color. Cause basically im just using the color pallet i sent but i like this border. we can change it later.</p>
    <p>I followed a whole tutorial on this top bar thing. It looks pretty cool but theres still a bunch in it i dont really undertstand like it sort of makes sense. Anyways its almost 1 so Ima hop off.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So I have changed up the collor pallete a bit. I frankly like the earthy green with the dirt brown but the blue is not it for sure. I dont know what I can swap it with tho. I have also decided to move over the links andchange the size of the logo.</p>
<p>Thinking about that topbar being a series of buttons that way it is something I understand better. It would also look cool it would just be missing the animation. Im hoping we can figure out how to do more fancy things but for now what we know is probably better. </p>

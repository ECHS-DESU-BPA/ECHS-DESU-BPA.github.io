    <p> Welcome to the "front page"</p>
    <br>
    <p> this is where we will be designing it just so that we can keep the plan and the other stuff on the index page</p>
    <br>
    <p> I want it to be this green but have this cream color. Cause basically im just using the color pallet i sent but i like this border. we can change it later.</p>
    <p>I followed a whole tutorial on this top bar thing. It looks pretty cool but theres still a bunch in it i dont really undertstand like it sort of makes sense. Anyways its almost 1 so Ima hop off.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So I have changed up the collor pallete a bit. I frankly like the earthy green with the dirt brown but the blue is not it for sure. I dont know what I can swap it with tho. I have also decided to move over the links andchange the size of the logo.</p>

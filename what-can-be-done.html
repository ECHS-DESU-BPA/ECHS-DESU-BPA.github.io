  There are many ways you can get involved! Whether that be alone or with others. Somethings you could do alone to start reducing your Carbon Footprint are...
  </p>
    <ul>
     <li>Unplugging your devices when they are not in use</li>
     <li>Using less temperature modifications (AC and Heat)</li> 
     <li>Carpool more with family</li>
     <li>Planting a tree</li>
     <li>Using energy efficent devices</li>
  </ul>
   <p>
     To explain further in the case of unplugging your devices is important because not only would this save money in your household but would also lower your energy usage. You also do not have to unplug every device that is in your household, just things that you can reach since most of the time things like tablets, computers, and other electronic devices will continue to use energy even if they aren't currently in use, which is known as a "phatom load". So unplugging these appliances will not only benefit you but will also lower your carbon footprint. Another thing you can do to reduce your carbon footprint in your house is using energy efficent appliances, which are usually marked with a blue energy star sticker, these appliances are as mentioned to use less energy therefore will contribute to lowering your carbon footprint/emission. Using the AC/heat in your household is convienent but your temperature control uses a lot of electricity and the materials they use to cool your house deplete ozone in the enviornment. Note, there is no reason to completely turn them off, just turn them down to reduce your carbon emmision. Doing things like turning the AC down in the winter and turning the heat down in the summer will make a noticeable difference in your energy usage and will reduce your carbon emmisions by a good amount. On the topic of reducing carbon emissions by a good amount, did you know that 29% (as of 2019) of carbon emissions come from vehicles? The reason for this is because of fossil fuels and the gases they put out when they are burned in the engine of a car. Now the way an easy way of reducing this astounding 29% (which most likely has grown tremendously in the last few years) is carpooling, and not only will it reduce the emissions/footprints of those involved (since you're using less vehicles). However, another way of reducing vehicle emissions is eletric cars which do not emit nearly as much gas as generic fossil fuel burning cars (although they are a bit expensive). You can also plant a tree to help offset emissions, this not only will benefit you but will benefit everyone. Althought it is a massive endevour to care for a tree, you could get the help of a neighbor or as a community can plant a few trees.

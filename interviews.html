  <br>
  <p> After interviewing some members of our community here in Delaware there have been some conclusions we can draw from the data recieved. </p>
  <br> 
  <img src="images/accurate-pie-chart.png">
  <br> 
  <p> Out of every one that we interviewed around 78% stated that they were actively doing things to reduce their carbon footprint, while around 22% stated that they were not. The 78% were asked what they did to actively reduce their Carbon Footprint/Emission and there were many mixed answwers, however none were unexpected. Some things they did to reduce their emmisions were walking to the store, riding the bus, unplugging appliances, and recycling occasionally. </p>
  <br>
  <p> As a follow up question to the last one, The participants (even those that were not actively trying to reduce their Carbon Footprint) were asked what they could do in the future to help reduce their Carbon Footprints. The range of answers also varried a lot for this question as well, but the general point of all of the answers was doing something that uses less energy/recourses. Things like leaving the water on too long in the shower, or using a ton of temperature control when its already a comfortable temperature are things that some people do without thinking. Just by doing those two things alone, over time this would be held accountable as a great increase to your Carbon Footprint. </p>
  <br>
  <p> As a final question, participants were asked what one thing a community could do to reduce their Carbon Footprint. Some participants stated that communities should hold meetings to discuss these things, some also said that communities should all just partake in a singular activity like unplugging devices that are not in use, some said that we should talk to the senators about investing more into public transportation, and some students said that communities should just try and invest in greener energy. The main point of it all is working toward sustainability, things like greener energy and investing into public transit may seem like an expensive waste, however they will definently reduce a communities Carbon Footprint by a large margin.

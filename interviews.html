  <h1> Local Interviews </h1>
  <br>
  <p> After interviewing some members of our community here in Delaware there have been some conclusions we can draw from the data recieved. </p>
  <br> 
  <img src="images/pie-chart.png">
  <br> 
  <p> Out of every one that we interviewed around 88% stated that they were actively doing things to reduce their carbon footprint, while 22% stated that they were not. The 88% were asked what they did to actively reduce their Carbon Footprint/Emission and there were many mixed answwers, however none were unexpected. Some things they did to reduce their emmisions were walking to the store, riding the bus, unplugging appliances, and recycling occasionally.
